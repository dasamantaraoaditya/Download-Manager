#1: Write a basic download manager


Given one of the sample URL's as input. The download manager should
- Use HEAD command of HTTP to get the meta-data (response-header) of the remote file
- Get the length of the file using value of "Content-Length" key in response-header
- start 4 threads and 
- simultaniously download the file as 4 parts and
- join the parts and 
- save in a file



The HTTP HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the
response body. This is useful for retrieving meta-information written in response
headers, without having to transport the entire content.

From the response headers, value of the "Content-Length" key will give you the length of
the remote file in bytes.
